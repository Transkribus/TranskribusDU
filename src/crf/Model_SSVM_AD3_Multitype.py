    #     Parameters
    #     ----------
    #     n_types : number of node types
    #     
    #     l_n_states : list of int, default=None
    #         Number of states per type of variables. 
    # 
    #     l_n_features : list of int, default=None
    #         Number of features per type of node. 
    # 
    #     a_n_edge_features: an array of shape (n_types, n_types) giving the number of features per pair of types
    #     
    #     NOTE: there should always be at least 1 feature for any pairs of types which has some edge in the graph.
    #           To mimic GraphCRF, pass 1 and make a constant feature of 1.0 for all those edges.  
    #     
    #     class_weight : None, or list of array-like (ndim=1)
    #         Class weights. If a list of array-like is passed, the Ith one must have length equal to l_n_states[i]
    #         None means equal class weights (across node types)

    #     X and Y
    #     -------

    #         - n_type_nodes is the number of nodes of that type
    #         - n_type_features is the number of features for this type of node
    #     
    #     Edges are given as a list of n_types x n_types arrays of shape (n_type_edges, 2). 
    #         Columns are resp.: node index (in corresponding node type), node index (in corresponding node type)
    #     
    #     Edge features are given as a list of n_types x n_types arrays of shape (n_type_type_edge, n_type_type_edge_features)
    #         - n_type_type_edge is the number of edges of type type_type
    #         - n_type_type_edge_features is the number of features for edge of type type_type
    #         
    #     An instance ``X`` is represented as a tuple ``([node_features, ..], [edges, ..], [edge_features, ..])`` 
    # 
    #     Labels ``Y`` are given as one array of shape (n_nodes)   
    #         Labels are numbered from 0 so that each label across types is encoded by a unique integer.
    #         
    #         Look at flattenY and unflattentY if you want to pass/obtain list of labels per type, with first label of each type being encoded by 0
