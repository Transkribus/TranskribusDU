    USAGE:  DU_Table_Annotator.py input-folder
    
    You must run this on your GT collection to create a training collection.
    
    If you pass a folder, you get a new folder with name postfixed  by a_
    
    Does 2 things:
    
    - 1 - 
    Annotate textlines  for Table understanding (finding rows and columns)
    
    It tags the TextLine, to indicate:
    - the table header, vs data, vs other stuff:
        @DU_header = 'CH'  |  'D'  |  'O'
        
    - the vertical rank in the table cell:
        @DU_row = 'B' | 'I' | 'E' | 'S' | 'O'
    
    - something regarding the number of text in a cell??
        # NO SURE THIS WORKS...
        @DU_col = 'M' | 'S' | 'O'
    
        
    - 2 - 
    Aggregate the borders of the cells by linear regression to reflect them
    as a line, which is stored as a SeparatorRegion element.
