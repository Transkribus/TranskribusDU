		RELEASE NOTES - TranskribusDU
		-----------------------------

--- Vulnéraire - 2020-08-07
- added support to evaluate the segmentation (see --eval_.. options)
- added support for oracle evaluation (--edge_oracle) indicating best achievable quality
- added support to record experiences in MLFLOW (see in options)
- fix for constructing graph when objects overlap each other (--g1o option)
- related to --g1o, better support for constructing object's bounding-box
- few bug and upgrade fix (e.g. in TestReport class, due to scipy evolution, ...)
